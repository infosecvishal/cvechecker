# cvechecker
This Python script is designed to enhance security assessments by integrating Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) identification into the network scanning process. Specifically, the script parses the output of the Nmap tool, extracts Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) identifiers, and utilizes them to identify associated CVEs.
